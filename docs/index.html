        <h2>What's tindhair?</h2>
        <p><strong>Tindhair is a mobile application which allows you to quickly find you a new hairstyle.</strong> It uses a recognizable interface and allows a user to create an account, like hairstyles to save them and upload their own hairstyle for others. I built this app while taking a course in interaction design at KTH, Royal Institute of Technology and set the goal to learn some relatively new techniques of building mobile apps.</p>
        <p>Tindhair is build with <strong>React Native</strong> and <strong>Redux</strong>. It is connected to a <strong>Node.js REST API</strong> that which handles all storage. The project was initialized with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/introducing-create-react-native-app.html">create-react-native-app</a> which placed a nice foundation for starting off the project. Besides that a handful of libraries were added for notifications, accessing the camera app, making requests etc.</p>
        <p><strong>I have learn a lot</strong> from creating the app, particularly in UX for mobile apps. Since I have a web-developer background most of the thinking was just how the elements should be placed to make most sense for a mobile app instead of a website. Besides that Redux brought pattern changes with regard to how state is being handled compared to MVC.</p>
